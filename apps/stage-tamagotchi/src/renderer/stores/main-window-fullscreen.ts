 * it holds, and a settings page keeps its route. Closing the mode leaves those pages through the router, so a page can

 *
 * Use when:
 * - An entry point opens a surface, the island switches it, or the main page runs the open and close transitions.

 * - The main page moves the window and the stage, and reports the end of each transition through `settle`.

 * - The phase, the surface, the mounted surfaces, and actions that open, resume, close, and settle the mode.
